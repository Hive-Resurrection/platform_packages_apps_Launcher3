# platform_packages_apps_Launcher3

Do not build. Working on some new UI for this. Let's not build something yet that is going to change a lot. 

Project idea

1. Remove Dock
2. Swipe Left now goes into app drawer.
3. Remove apps from being on pages. Force them to only be in the app drawer
4. Swiping right will bring up pages that include widgets. Pages can be added and deleted. 
   Swiping Right will be an infinite loop of pages.
5. Swiping from bottom will bring up a box view of all pages with widgets.


*Progress*
